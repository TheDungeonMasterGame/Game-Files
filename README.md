# Game-Files



//Dev note

This is the repository where all of the game files will be kept while the game is still in development. If you would like to aid in the development of the game please contact us directly at somethinginterestinggames@gmail.com.


//side note

please do not tamper with the game files if you are not an active developer of the game. We need to make sure the game is fit for every one of it's release dates.
